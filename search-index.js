page describes the graphical notation for ontology diagrams generated by owl-cli. There is no standard diagram notation for OWL, but a number of tools provide their own notation. Popular options are the Protégé plugins OWLViz and OntoGraf, as well as the graphical notation of Topbraid Composer. Most notations have a strong focus on class and instance relationships, which is well-suited for visualizing this particular kind of ontology. However, other types of axioms, in particular more complex class expressions, are usually not represented. For this reason, during the writing of the PhD thesis, a more general graphical notation for ontologies was developed. The notation by owl-cli is influenced by the following other notations for OWL ontologies: The symbols and colors for classes, properties and data types as popularized by the Protégé ontology editor and also used by Topbraid Composer. The notation from the PhD thesis (as shown on pages 43 and 44), but with less focus on Description Logics notation and instead using the expressions syntax from Protégé. Arrows from UML (hollow arrow for inheritance, solid arrow for relations). Representation of OWL class restrictions and other elements in the specification of the OMG Ontology Definition Metamodel 1.1, cf. for example Figures 14.25, 14.26 and 14.27. The symbol for disjoint unions that is used in VOWL. The notation was designed with the following goals in mind: It must be possible to represent all OWL axioms in a meaningful way. The diagrams are used mainly for visualizing in documents, not necessarily for interactively editing an ontology. The diagram should be understandable for people familiar with the Protégé editor, because it is probably the most popular ontology editor. The semantics should be unambiguous from the visual representation: For example, using a UML-like class diagram for an OWL class that includes properties in its box like class attributes in UML is not self-explanatory: Are the properties restrictions on the class (existential? universal? both?), is the class the domain of the properties? Both have very different meanings than what a UML-like representation suggests. The following sections describe the graphical notation using examples. All diagrams on this page were generated with owl-cli. Each diagram links to the RDF/Turtle file it was generated from. Table 1.

It targets the Web Ontology Language (OWL 2) and RDF. You can generate a diagram for an OWL ontology with the diagram command read any RDF document in RDF/Turtle, RDF/XML, RDF N-Triples or N3 format and write it in configurable, pretty-printed RDF/Turtle or one of the other formats using the write command You can find the source code on Github. Things you will need to have installed to run owl-cli: Graphviz for the generation of diagrams. Install in Windows (using Chocolatey): choco install graphviz Install in MacOs (using Brew): brew install graphviz Install in Ubuntu/Debian Linux: apt install graphviz Download the pre-built binary for your platform: owl-x86_64-windows-snapshot.exe owl-x86_64-apple-darwin-snapshot owl-x86_64-linux-snapshot For other platforms or architectures, please use the executable .jar file: owl-cli-snapshot.jar. This requires Java (OpenJDK) 16 or newer. Rename the binary to owl.exe (Windows) or owl (MacOs/Linux), put it in your favorite directory and add this directory to the PATH environment variable: Windows: setx /M path \"%path%;C:\\your\\path\\here\\\" MacOs/Linux: echo 'export PATH=/your/path/here:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc; source ~/.bashrc If using the executable .jar file, the following commands will make the jar available as owl command as well. This works in MacOs and Linux. curl -L -o ~/.local/share/owl-cli/owl-cli.jar --create-dirs https://github.com/atextor/owl-cli/releases/download/{release-version}/owl-cli-{release-version}.jar echo 'function owl() { java -jar ~/.local/share/owl-cli/owl-cli.jar $*; }' >> ~/.bashrc source ~/.bashrc After installation, you can use the owl command: See Usage for more information. For building the executable JAR file for owl-cli, you need Java 16. We recommend installation of the GraalVM-based JDK 16 using SDKMAN!. Run the following commands: # The following commands install SDKMAN!. If you have it installed already, you can skip it. curl -sL https://get.sdkman.io | bash echo sdkman_auto_answer=true > $HOME/.sdkman/etc/config echo sdkman_auto_selfupdate=true >> $HOME/.sdkman/etc/config source $HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh # Use SDKMAN! to install JDK sdk install java 21.2.0.r16-grl sdk use java 21.2.0.r16-grl # Build the project git clone https://github.com/atextor/owl-cli.git cd owl-cli ./gradlew This will build cli/build/libs/owl-cli-snapshot.jar, which you then can install locally: mkdir -p ~/.local/share/owl-cli cp cli/build/libs/owl-cli-snapshot.jar !$/owl-cli.jar echo 'function owl() { java -jar ~/.local/share/owl-cli/owl-cli.jar $*; }' >> ~/.bashrc source ~/.bashrc After that, you can use the owl command: See Usage for more information. For building the owl-cli native binary, GraalVM is used. As Java 15+ source features are used, a JDK 16-based GraalVM version is required. For calling GraalVM’s native-image command, the gradle build relies on the install locations as used by SDKMAN!. The following instructions assume a BASH shell. On MacOs and Linux this is the default shell; on Windows you would have to use e.g. Git Bash or WSL2. Also on Windows, you will need to install Microsoft Visual C++. Please follow the GraalVM installation instructions. Run the following commands: # The following commands install SDKMAN!.

Other than the general help, you give one argument, the command, which will take its own arguments, for example: owl diagram --format png Commands that take ontology files as an input support all formats that are supported by OWL API, notably RDF/Turtle, RDF/XML, OWL/XML and OWL Functional Syntax. The diagram command takes an OWL ontology as input and generates an automatically layouted diagram for it in the SVG or PNG format. This is implemented by mapping the ontology’s axioms into a graph description in the Graphviz language, which is passed to its dot layouting engine. Attributes such as fonts can be customized using arguments. As no standardized graphical notation for OWL exists, the diagram notation used here is described in detail on a separate page: Diagram Notation. General usage: owl diagram [options] input [output], where input can be either an ontology file or - (which means: read from standard in) and output can be either an ontology file or - (which means: write to standard out).

There is no standard diagram notation for OWL, but a number of tools provide their own notation. Popular options are the Protégé plugins OWLViz and OntoGraf, as well as the graphical notation of Topbraid Composer. Most notations have a strong focus on class and instance relationships, which is well-suited for visualizing this particular kind of ontology. However, other types of axioms, in particular more complex class expressions, are usually not represented. For this reason, during the writing of the PhD thesis, a more general graphical notation for ontologies was developed. The notation by owl-cli is influenced by the following other notations for OWL ontologies: The symbols and colors for classes, properties and data types as popularized by the Protégé ontology editor and also used by Topbraid Composer. The notation from the PhD thesis (as shown on pages 43 and 44), but with less focus on Description Logics notation and instead using the expressions syntax from Protégé. Arrows from UML (hollow arrow for inheritance, solid arrow for relations). Representation of OWL class restrictions and other elements in the specification of the OMG Ontology Definition Metamodel 1.1, cf. for example Figures 14.25, 14.26 and 14.27. The symbol for disjoint unions that is used in VOWL. The notation was designed with the following goals in mind: It must be possible to represent all OWL axioms in a meaningful way. The diagrams are used mainly for visualizing in documents, not necessarily for interactively editing an ontology. The diagram should be understandable for people familiar with the Protégé editor, because it is probably the most popular ontology editor. The semantics should be unambiguous from the visual representation: For example, using a UML-like class diagram for an OWL class that includes properties in its box like class attributes in UML is not self-explanatory: Are the properties restrictions on the class (existential? universal? both?), is the class the domain of the properties? Both have very different meanings than what a UML-like representation suggests. The following sections describe the graphical notation using examples. All diagrams on this page were generated with owl-cli. Each diagram links to the RDF/Turtle file it was generated from. Table 1.

It targets the Web Ontology Language (OWL 2) and RDF. The current main feature is the generation of automatically layed out diagrams for an OWL ontology. You can find the source code on Github. Things you will need to have installed to run owl-cli: Java (OpenJDK) 11 or newer Graphviz for the generation of diagrams. Note that this is a common package that can be installed via all popular package managers, for example apt-get, brew or rpm. Open your favorite terminal emulator and execute the following commands: curl -L -o ~/.local/share/owl-cli/owl-cli.jar --create-dirs https://github.com/atextor/owl-cli/releases/download/snapshot/owl-cli.jar echo 'function owl() { java -jar ~/.local/share/owl-cli/owl-cli.jar $*; }' >> ~/.bashrc source ~/.bashrc After installation, you can use the owl command: See Usage for more information. owl-cli uses Java 15 source features, but the build generates a Java 11-compatible JAR file. This means, for building the executable JAR file, you need Java 15. The gradle build forks jobs where it expects Java 15 to be installed in a certain place (see Building the native image (executable binary) from source for an explanation). We rely on the locations as used by SDKMAN!. Run the following commands: # The following commands install SDKMAN!.

This means, for building the native image, you need both Java 11 (i.e. GraalVM JDK) and Java 15. In particular, the gradle build must be executed using Java 11, while Java 15 is installed in a certain place where the build can find it. We rely on the locations as used by SDKMAN!.
