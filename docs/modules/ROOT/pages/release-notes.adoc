= Release Notes

== Version 1.2.4
* Changes in xref:usage.adoc#write-command[write] command: Triple-quotes strings that happen to end
  with a quote are escaped correctly.

== Version 1.2.3

* Changes in xref:usage.adoc#write-command[write] command: Special characters in the URIs are
  serialized correctly (using Jena RIOT); if characters are invalid in a local name, the full URI is
  printed. The longest available prefixes are used.

== Version 1.2.2

* Change in xref:usage.adoc#write-command[write] command: Dashes, underscores and full stops in the
  name part of local names are not escaped any more. Both variants are valid, but reading RDF/Turtle
  is easier without the escapes.

== Version 1.2.1

* Bugfix in xref:usage.adoc#write-command[write] command: Dashes in the prefix part of local names
  are not escaped any more

== Version 1.2.0

* Adds the xref:usage.adoc#infer-command[infer] command to perform OWL DL reasoning on an input
  ontology.
* Bugfixes in xref:usage.adoc#write-command[write] command: Local names (curies) with escaped
  special characters are correctly parsed now; local names and literals are correctly escaped when
  writing.

== Version 1.1.0

* Adds the xref:usage.adoc#write-command[write] command to read RDF files in multiple formats and
  write them out. When choosing RDF/Turtle as output format, the output is pretty-printed and
  formatting can be controlled.

== Version 1.0.0

* This is the first released version.
* It supports the xref:usage.adoc#diagram-command[diagram] command to automatically generate diagrams from OWL ontologies.
