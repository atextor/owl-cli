= owl-cli

(Version *{page-component-version}*)

*owl-cli* is a command line tool for ontology engineering. It targets the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language[Web Ontology Language] (OWL 2) and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework[RDF]. You can

* generate a diagram for an OWL ontology with the xref:usage.adoc#diagram-command[diagram command]
* read any RDF document in https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/[RDF/Turtle],
https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/[RDF/XML],
https://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/[RDF N-Triples] or
https://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/n3/[N3] format and write it in configurable, pretty-printed
RDF/Turtle or one of the other formats using the xref:usage.adoc#write-command[write command]
* perform OWL DL reasoning on an input ontology using the xref:usage.adoc#infer-command[infer command]

You can find the source code on https://github.com/atextor/owl-cli[Github].

|===

For other platforms or architectures, please use the executable .jar file: https://github.com/atextor/owl-cli/releases/download/{release-tag}/owl-cli-{release-version}.jar[owl-cli-{release-version}.jar]. This requires Java (OpenJDK) *17* or newer.

Rename the binary to `owl.exe` (Windows) or `owl` (MacOs/Linux), put it in your favorite directory
and add this directory to the PATH environment variable:

* Windows: `setx /M path "%path%;C:\your\path\here\"`
* MacOs/Linux: `echo 'export PATH=/your/path/here:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc; source ~/.bashrc`

[NOTE]
====
If using the executable .jar file, the following commands will make the jar available as `owl`
command as well. This works in MacOs and Linux.

[source,shell]
----
curl -L -o ~/.local/share/owl-cli/owl-cli.jar --create-dirs https://github.com/atextor/owl-cli/releases/download/{release-version}/owl-cli-{release-version}.jar
echo 'function owl() { java -jar ~/.local/share/owl-cli/owl-cli.jar $*; }' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
----
====

After installation, you can use the `owl` command: See xref:usage.adoc[] for more information.

== Building from Source

[[building-executable-jar]]
=== Building the executable JAR from source

For building the executable JAR file for *owl-cli*, you need Java *17*. We recommend installation
of the GraalVM-based JDK 17 using https://sdkman.io/[SDKMAN!].

Run the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
# The following commands install SDKMAN!. If you have it installed already, you can skip it.
curl -sL https://get.sdkman.io | bash
echo sdkman_auto_answer=true > $HOME/.sdkman/etc/config
echo sdkman_auto_selfupdate=true >> $HOME/.sdkman/etc/config
source $HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh

# Use SDKMAN! to install JDK
sdk install java 21.3.0.r17-grl
sdk use java 21.3.0.r17-grl

# Build the project
git clone https://github.com/atextor/owl-cli.git
cd owl-cli
./gradlew
----

This will build `cli/build/libs/owl-cli-snapshot.jar`, which you then can install locally:

[source,shell]
----
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/owl-cli
cp cli/build/libs/owl-cli-snapshot.jar !$/owl-cli.jar
echo 'function owl() { java -jar ~/.local/share/owl-cli/owl-cli.jar $*; }' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
----

After that, you can use the `owl` command: See xref:usage.adoc[] for more information.

[[building-native-image]]
=== Building the native image (executable binary) from source

For building the *owl-cli* native binary, https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM] is used. As Java 15+
source features are used, a JDK 17-based GraalVM version is required. For calling GraalVM's
`native-image` command, the `gradle` build relies on the install locations as used by
https://sdkman.io/[SDKMAN!].

The following instructions assume a BASH shell. On MacOs and Linux this is the default shell; on
Windows you would have to use e.g. https://gitforwindows.org/[Git Bash] or
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10[WSL2].

Also on Windows, you will need to install Microsoft Visual C++. Please follow the
https://www.graalvm.org/docs/getting-started/windows/[GraalVM installation instructions].

Run the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
# The following commands install SDKMAN!. If you have it installed already,
# you can skip it.
# Ubuntu only: SDKMAN! installation requires zip/unzip:
sudo apt-get install zip unzip
# Windows only: SDKMAN! installation requires zip/unzip:
choco install zip
choco install unzip
# Install SDKMAN!
curl -sL https://get.sdkman.io | bash
echo sdkman_auto_answer=true > $HOME/.sdkman/etc/config
echo sdkman_auto_selfupdate=true >> $HOME/.sdkman/etc/config
source $HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh

# Use SDKMAN! to install JDK
sdk install java 21.3.0.r17-grl
sdk use java 21.2.0.r17-grl
# Use GraalVMs update tool to install the native-image command
gu install native-image

# Ubuntu only: Install build dependencies
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libz-dev

# Build the project
git clone https://github.com/atextor/owl-cli.git
cd owl-cli
./gradlew nativeImage
----

This will build `cli/build/bin/owl`, which you can put anywhere on your `PATH`.
